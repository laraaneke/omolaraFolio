                    <h2>Under The Hood </h2>
                    <p> A suit made using a sewing machine is considered hand-crafted despite the machine-made
                        interventions. In comparison, a portrait made using a stylus and device is considered a digital
                        drawing. Intrigued by this sentiment, I thought back to my first day of undergrad. We were told
                        to go out to the world and quickly sketch what we saw. The idea here was to gather as much
                        information to later be called upon when looking for interesting shapes, lines and directions
                        for women's clothing. I tried to emulate this process as much a possible from quickly drawing
                        what it sees in the world down to the blind contour style line drawings. The idea was to
                        automate the sometimes-taxing prototyping process in a very specific way that doesn't dismiss
                        all
                        human intervention.


                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Currently the process to take an image from pixels to plotted on paper is quite an involved
                        process that
                        uses a pleather of programs. Typically, an image is uploaded to Inkscape, the vector information
                        is
                        found, saved via a plugin extension, Arduino is loaded with GRBL uploaded, then processing is
                        used to
                        stream the file to the Arduino. I initially had ambitious plans to create a fully functional
                        web-based
                        application that prints the input without the added extra programs. This wasn't quite
                        actualised.

                        I took the opportunity to begin learning JavaScript so I make use of Vanilla js, OpenCV.js and
                        P5.js.
                        Together they allow me to make an application that takes in a picture or webcam still and
                        produces a
                        gcode file that is manually uploaded to the Source Rabbit gcode Sender software. The sender
                        connects and
                        streams the gcode to the Arduino setup moving the motors accordingly.

                        My starting point was figuring out how to turn images into gcode without Inkscape. Initial
                        testing
                        involved finding and converting svg information into gcode but I couldn't figure out how to turn
                        stills
                        into svg files information. I then came a across a thread that explained I should first find the
                        edges,
                        then turn the edges into gcode. As vague as it seemed at the time, it was great information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Vanilla js is used to encapsulate the various programs. It is here that I make the calls to
                        OpenCv.js
                        and P5js and draw the outcome to the canvas. OpenCv.js is used to process the still, it goes
                        through
                        various stages of manipulation from making grayscale, finding the edges then using the edges to
                        find the
                        contours. A delicate balance in needed to contrast the image just enough to pick up the
                        important
                        details without picking up the excess noise. Where I was hell bent on using blurring and
                        thresholding
                        just because I can, I was over processing the images resulting in a different line being found.
                        The
                        contours found are then used as the basis for coordinates sent through an algorithm that
                        produces a file
                        with the .gcode extension. P5js is used to easily use and manipulate the webcam stream. I
                        enjoyed the
                        look of the lines created when slit scan style images were fed through the system, so this was
                        the
                        starting point for the webcam manipulation. </p>
