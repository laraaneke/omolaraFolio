                        THE PROBLEM: I left universiy with a
                        fashion Pattern cutting degree and Ideas of grandure that were far
                        removed from my skillset. As someone with a creative backgound, being
                        able to go from skecth to product is my job; making, learning and experienting are my strenghs.
                        As a result, I learnt to program.
                        <br>
                        I went my whole educatonal carrier without learning
                        anything remotely digital to hold me in good stead considering the new digatal era we are
                        in, creativlely or otherwise. I only take note of this as there is now a push for
                        compulsary computer science lesson at school, there must be a reason for this.

                                programmed two types of interactions into the processing sketch for the ruse to decide

                            <p class="p1"> A suit made using a sewing machine is considered hand-crafted despite the
                                machine-made
                                interventions. In comparison, a portrait made using a stylus and device is considered a
                                digital
                                drawing. Intrigued by this sentiment, I thought back to my first day of undergrad. We
                                were
                                told
                                to go out to the world and quickly sketch what we saw. The idea here was to gather as
                                much
                                information to later be called upon when looking for interesting shapes, lines and
                                directions
                                for women's clothing. I tried to emulate this process as much a possible from quickly
                                drawing
                                what it sees in the world down to the blind contour style line drawings. The idea was to
                                automate the sometimes-taxing prototyping process in a very specific way that doesn't
                                dismiss
                                all
                                human intervention.

                                    quite an
                                    involved
                                    process that
                                    uses a pleather of programs. Typically, an image is uploaded to Inkscape, the vector
                                    information
                                    is
                                    found, saved via a plugin extension, Arduino is loaded with GRBL uploaded, then
                                    processing
                                    is
                                    used to
                                    stream the file to the Arduino. I initially had ambitious plans to create a fully
                                    functional
                                    web-based
                                    application that prints the input without the added extra programs. This wasn't
                                    quite
                                    actualised.

                                    I took the opportunity to begin learning JavaScript so I make use of Vanilla js,
                                    OpenCV.js
                                    and
                                    P5.js.
                                    Together they allow me to make an application that takes in a picture or webcam
                                    still
                                    and
                                    produces a
                                    gcode file that is manually uploaded to the Source Rabbit gcode Sender software. The
                                    sender
                                    connects and
                                    streams the gcode to the Arduino setup moving the motors accordingly.

                                    My starting point was figuring out how to turn images into gcode without Inkscape.
                                    Initial
                                    testing
                                    involved finding and converting svg information into gcode but I couldn't figure out
                                    how
                                    to
                                    turn
                                    stills
                                    into svg files information. I then came a across a thread that explained I should
                                    first
                                    find
                                    the
                                    edges,
                                    then turn the edges into gcode. As vague as it seemed at the time, it was great
                                    information.

                                <p class="p3"> Vanilla js is used to encapsulate the various programs. It is here that I
                                    make
                                    the calls to

                                    and P5js and draw the outcome to the canvas. OpenCv.js is used to process the still,

                                    goes
                                    through
                                    various stages of manipulation from making grayscale, finding the edges then using
                                    the
                                    edges

                                    contours. A delicate balance in needed to contrast the image just enough to pick up
                                    the
                                    important
                                    details without picking up the excess noise. Where I was hell bent on using blurring
                                    and
                                    thresholding
                                    just because I can, I was over processing the images resulting in a different line
                                    being
                                    found.

                                    contours found are then used as the basis for coordinates sent through an algorithm
                                    that
                                    produces a file

                                    I
                                    enjoyed the
                                    look of the lines created when slit scan style images were fed through the system,
                                    so
                                    this
                                    was
                                    the
                                    starting point for the webcam manipulation. </p>
