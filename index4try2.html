                        THE PROBLEM: I left universiy with a
                        fashion Pattern cutting degree and Ideas of grandure that were far
                        removed from my skillset. As someone with a creative backgound, being
                        able to go from skecth to product is my job; making, learning and experienting are my strenghs.
                        As a result, I learnt to program.
                        <br>
                        I went my whole educatonal carrier without learning
                        anything remotely digital to hold me in good stead considering the new digatal era we are
                        in, creativlely or otherwise. I only take note of this as there is now a push for
                        compulsary computer science lesson at school, there must be a reason for this.

                        <h2>Under The Hood </h2>
                        <p> The system uses Arduino and Processing connected via the seiral port. the Arduino sketch is
                            configured
                            to receive a switch of bits containing 8 0’s and 1 from processing. I
                            programmed two types of interactions into the processing sketch for the ruse to decide for
                            themselves
                            what feels more intuitive when weaving. You can press the numbers 1- through 8 on the
                            keyboard
                            and press
                            ‘o’ also on the keyboard to clear everything selected in order to move onto the next row.
                            Pressing the
                            keys means the white box at the corresponding position turns black letting you know it's
                            that
                            slot if
                            pressed. Or if you so chose, you could move the mouse to press the button labelled with the
                            intended
                            switch number. This action activated the black and white check also whilst changing the
                            colour
                            of the
                            button to further let you know when what buttons are activated or not.
                            <br> <br>
                            Both interactions from the
                            Processing sketch communicate with the Arduino via serial to turn on the respective servo
                            motor
                            attached
                            to the corresponding number. The up and down motion created acts as the warp, and the left
                            and
                            right
                            motion made by the user acts as the weft to create an interlocked pattern. The warp threads
                            are
                            held by
                            individual servos and move up and down when prompted. My loom is designed in the same vein
                            as a
                            jacquard
                            loom rather than the traditional rigid loom. You can access each warp individually allowing
                            practitioners to design an infinite number of patterns. Pattern designs are limited to what
                            you
                            can
                            research or conjure up as you go as well as the number of servos attached at one time.

                        <h2>Under The Hood </h2>
                        <p> A suit made using a sewing machine is considered hand-crafted despite the machine-made
                            interventions. In comparison, a portrait made using a stylus and device is considered a
                            digital
                            drawing. Intrigued by this sentiment, I thought back to my first day of undergrad. We were
                            told
                            to go out to the world and quickly sketch what we saw. The idea here was to gather as much
                            information to later be called upon when looking for interesting shapes, lines and
                            directions
                            for women's clothing. I tried to emulate this process as much a possible from quickly
                            drawing
                            what it sees in the world down to the blind contour style line drawings. The idea was to
                            automate the sometimes-taxing prototyping process in a very specific way that doesn't
                            dismiss
                            all
                            human intervention.

                        <br>
                        <p>Currently the process to take an image from pixels to plotted on paper is quite an involved
                            process that
                            uses a pleather of programs. Typically, an image is uploaded to Inkscape, the vector
                            information
                            is
                            found, saved via a plugin extension, Arduino is loaded with GRBL uploaded, then processing
                            is
                            used to
                            stream the file to the Arduino. I initially had ambitious plans to create a fully functional
                            web-based
                            application that prints the input without the added extra programs. This wasn't quite
                            actualised.

                            I took the opportunity to begin learning JavaScript so I make use of Vanilla js, OpenCV.js
                            and
                            P5.js.
                            Together they allow me to make an application that takes in a picture or webcam still and
                            produces a
                            gcode file that is manually uploaded to the Source Rabbit gcode Sender software. The sender
                            connects and
                            streams the gcode to the Arduino setup moving the motors accordingly.

                            My starting point was figuring out how to turn images into gcode without Inkscape. Initial
                            testing
                            involved finding and converting svg information into gcode but I couldn't figure out how to
                            turn
                            stills
                            into svg files information. I then came a across a thread that explained I should first find
                            the
                            edges,
                            then turn the edges into gcode. As vague as it seemed at the time, it was great information.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Vanilla js is used to encapsulate the various programs. It is here that I make the calls to
                            OpenCv.js
                            and P5js and draw the outcome to the canvas. OpenCv.js is used to process the still, it goes
                            through
                            various stages of manipulation from making grayscale, finding the edges then using the edges
                            to
                            find the
                            contours. A delicate balance in needed to contrast the image just enough to pick up the
                            important
                            details without picking up the excess noise. Where I was hell bent on using blurring and
                            thresholding
                            just because I can, I was over processing the images resulting in a different line being
                            found.
                            The
                            contours found are then used as the basis for coordinates sent through an algorithm that
                            produces a file
                            with the .gcode extension. P5js is used to easily use and manipulate the webcam stream. I
                            enjoyed the
                            look of the lines created when slit scan style images were fed through the system, so this
                            was
                            the
                            starting point for the webcam manipulation. </p>
